# Hi there :wave:

Developer with more than 5 years of experience. From the very beginning of my career, I have been involved in one way or another with things related to compilers, static analysis or tooling for languages.

I have experience in the following areas:

- Writing lexers and parsers for various languages (PHP, Golang, TypeScript, Spawn, Tact, Tolk). From scratch and using generators such as Bison. Including for a huge amount of code (8 million lines of PHP code). I also have experience in writing grammars for several languages ([V](https://github.com/v-analyzer/v-analyzer/blob/main/tree_sitter_v/grammar.cjs), Spawn, [Tact](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server/tree/master/server/src/languages/tact/tree-sitter-tact), [Tolk](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton-language-server/tree/main/server/src/languages/tolk/tree-sitter-tolk), [TL-B](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server/tree/master/server/src/languages/tlb/tree-sitter-tlb)) for Tree-sitter.
- Writing static analyzers ([NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify), [NoColor](https://github.com/VKCOM/nocolor))
- Writing compilers: Spawn, [KPHP](https://github.com/VKCOM/kphp), [Tact](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact), understand the concepts of SSA, IR, CFG, DFA
- Writing plugins for JetBrains IDEs, from scratch: [AdmStorm](https://github.com/VKCOM/admstorm), [NoColor](https://github.com/i582/nocolor-phpstorm), [Modulite]( https://github.com/VKCOM/modulite), [Vlang](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20287-vlang), Spawn, [Tact](https://github.com/tact-lang/intelli-tact), including experience working on PhpStorm at JetBrains
- Writing plugins for VS Code: [v-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VOSCA.vscode-v-analyzer), spawn-analyzer, [Tact](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonstudio.vscode-tact) and [TON (Tolk, FunC, Fift, TL-B)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ton-core.vscode-ton)
- Writing Language Servers: [v-analyzer](https://github.com/v-analyzer/v-analyzer), spawn-analyzer, [Tact](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server) and [TON (Tolk, FunC, Fift, TL-B)](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton-language-server)
- Writing formatters: spawnfmt, [tactfmt](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/tree/main/src/fmt) and [tolkfmt](https://github.com/i582/tolkfmt)
- Writing specifications and documentation for the language (Spawn)
- Writing additional tools for the language (spawnfmt, spawnpkg, spawnup, spawnprof)
