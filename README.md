# Hi there :wave:

I am interested in :pencil: **static analysis**, :hammer: **compilers** and :wrench: **developer tools**.

- I’m currently working as a junior developer in the [@VK (vk.com)](https://github.com/VKCOM/) team on the [NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify) static analyzer, [NoColor](https://github.com/VKCOM/nocolor) architecture validation tool and [KPHP](https://github.com/VKCOM/kphp) compiler;
- I write in Go ʕ◔ϖ◔ʔ, C++ and a bit Java/Kotlin;
- I am [learning](https://github.com/i582/nocolor-phpstorm) to create plugins for the IntelliJ platform in Java/Kotlin.
- I enjoy playing [chess](https://lichess.org/@/Makhneff), shogi (Japanese chess) and alpine skiing;
- I enjoy designing and 3D modeling;
- I have 0 cats; :( But I have one duck for programming. :)
