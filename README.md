# Hi there :wave:

Developer with more than 4 years of experience. From the very beginning of my career, I have been involved in one way or another with things related to compilers or static analysis of languages.

I have experience in the following areas:

- Writing lexers and parsers for various languages (PHP, Golang, TypeScript). From scratch and using generators such as Bison. Including for a huge amount of code (8 million lines of PHP code). I also have experience in writing grammars for two languages ([V](https://github.com/v-analyzer/v-analyzer/blob/main/tree_sitter_v/grammar.cjs), Spawn*) from scratch for Tree-sitter.
- Writing static analyzers ([NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify), [NoColor](https://github.com/VKCOM/nocolor))
- Writing compilers (Spawn*, [KPHP](https://github.com/VKCOM/kphp)), understand the concepts of SSA, IR, CFG, DFA
- Writing plugins for JetBrains IDEs, from scratch: [AdmStorm](https://github.com/VKCOM/admstorm), [NoColor](https://github.com/i582/nocolor-phpstorm), [Modulite]( https://github.com/VKCOM/modulite), [Vlang](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20287-vlang), Spawn*, including experience working on PhpStorm at JetBrains
- Writing plugins for VS Code: [v-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VOSCA.vscode-v-analyzer) and spawn-analyzer*
- Writing Language Servers: [v-analyzer](https://github.com/v-analyzer/v-analyzer) and spawn-analyzer*
- Writing specifications and documentation for the language (Spawn*)
- Writing additional tools for the language (spawnfmt\*, spawnpkg\*, spawnup\*, spawnprof\*)
