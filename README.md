# Hi there :wave:

I'm interested in :pencil: **static analysis**, :hammer: **compilers**, :wrench: **developer tools** and :electric_plug: IntelliJ-based **plugins**.

I'm currently working in the PhpStorm team at JetBrains.

In my free time, I write a plugin for [V language support](https://github.com/intellij-v/intellij-v) in the JetBrains IDE.

Previously I'm working on VK developer tools such as [NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify) (related to fork of [php-parser](https://github.com/VKCOM/php-parser)), a static analyzer for PHP that is capable of checking over 8 million lines for each MR. Experimental [NoColor](https://github.com/VKCOM/nocolor) architecture validator on KPHP team concept of colors. And plugins like [AdmStorm](https://github.com/VKCOM/admstorm), [NoColor](https://github.com/i582/nocolor-phpstorm), [KPHPStorm](https://github.com/unserialize/kphpstorm) or [Modulite](https://github.com/VKCOM/modulite) for PhpStorm to make it easier for developers to write code. I also do a little work on compiler [KPHP](https://github.com/VKCOM/kphp) for PHP which translates it into C++, thereby speeding it up at times.

I use Go ʕ◔ϖ◔ʔ, C++, Kotlin, Java and excellent IDEs from JetBrains for writing code.

Also:

- I enjoy playing [chess](https://lichess.org/@/Makhneff), shogi (Japanese chess) and alpine skiing;
- I enjoy designing and 3D modeling;
- I have one duck for programming.
